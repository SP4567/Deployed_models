**Email/SMS Spam Classifier**
The Email/SMS Spam classifier model takes an email or message as an input tokenize it, converts it into the vector form by the process of vectorization and using the vectors tries to predict and classifies whether the email or a sms is spam or not.
Here's a breakdown of how they work:
1. *Data Collection:*  Training data is collected, which consists of emails and SMS messages that are already labeled as spam or not spam.
2. *Data Preprocessing:* The text data is cleaned and formatted for the machine learning model. This may involve removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and removing irrelevant words.
3. *Model Building*  A machine learning model is trained on the labeled data. Common algorithms for this task include Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
4. *Classification:* Once trained, the model can then analyze new emails and SMS messages and predict whether they are spam or not spam.
